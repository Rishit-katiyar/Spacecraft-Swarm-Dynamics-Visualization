# Spacecraft Swarm Dynamics Visualization üõ∞Ô∏èüåå

Welcome to the Spacecraft Swarm Dynamics Visualization repository! This project aims to visualize spacecraft swarm dynamics, illustrating coordinated motion, communication networks, and distributed sensing capabilities of swarms of small satellites or spacecraft formations.

## Introduction
Spacecraft swarm dynamics refer to the coordinated motion, communication networks, and distributed sensing capabilities of multiple spacecraft operating together in space. Understanding and visualizing these dynamics are crucial for various space missions, including satellite constellations, asteroid exploration, and space debris management.

## Why Spacecraft Swarm Dynamics Visualization?
Spacecraft Swarm Dynamics Visualization provides a comprehensive tool for researchers, engineers, and space enthusiasts to explore and understand the behavior of spacecraft swarms. By visualizing coordinated motion, communication networks, and distributed sensing, users can gain valuable insights into the complex dynamics of these swarms, enabling better mission planning, spacecraft design, and space exploration strategies.

## Installation
To use Spacecraft Swarm Dynamics Visualization, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/Spacecraft-Swarm-Dynamics-Visualization.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
Use the `cd` command to navigate into the project directory:

```
cd Spacecraft-Swarm-Dynamics-Visualization
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
Install the required Python dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the visualization script to observe spacecraft swarm dynamics.

### Running the script:
Run the following command to start the simulation:

```
python Spacecraft-Swarm-Dynamics-Visualization.py
```

Upon running the script, you will be prompted to select a mode for initializing the spacecraft swarm. Choose between "grid" or "circle" mode by entering the corresponding number and press Enter. The simulation will then start automatically.
